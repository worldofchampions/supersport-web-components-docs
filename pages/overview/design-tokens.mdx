# Design Tokens

Design tokens are a tech-agnostic way to store variables. We use tokens instead of hard coded values to ensure a
better UI consistency across different platforms.

Design tokens are the building blocks of all UI elements. In SWC, tokens
are [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
that can be used to style components.
