# React

SuperSport Web Componenets are offerred via a React version for webcomponents. You can view both html and react samples in the documentation.

## Installation

To add crayons to your React app, install the package from our package manager.

```bash
npm install @supersport/ss-web-components@v0.1
```

## Usage

### Importing components

Every SuperSport Web Componenet is available to import as a React component. For using button, please note we will
be using `<SsButton>` instead of `<ss-button>`

```jsx copy
import { SsButton } from "@supersport/webcomponents/react";

const App = () => <SsButton color="primary">Click me</SsButton>;

export default App;
```

### Event Handling

SuperSport Web Components emit custom events. For example, the button component emits the ssClick event when it is getting
clicked. In React, you can listen for the event using onSsClick.

You can find the list of properties, events and methods for the webcomponent under each component's documentation.

```jsx copy
import { SsButton } from "@supersport/webcomponents/react";

const App = () => (
	<SsButton
		color="primary"
		onSsClick={() => console.log("ssClick event emitted from button")}
	>
		Click me
	</SsButton>
);

export default App;
```
