# Why Web Components?

Web components provides a way to create our own HTML elements and use them in any framework.

With every growing popularity of frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular component driven development has become a need. Components
help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable blocks.

Drawbacks with Framework specific components:

- The components can only be used in their specific framework.
- Any new framework or version changes can lead to breaking changes and require substantial effort to update the components.
- Web components solve these problems.
- They're supported by all modern browsers.
- They're framework agnostic.
- They're a part of the web standard.

## What is Nextra?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** site generation framework with everything you love from Next.js.

## Quick Start

<Cards num={2}>
	<Cards.Card image arrow title="Promo Banner" href="/components/promo_banner">
		<>![Promo Banner](/promo.png)</>
	</Cards.Card>
	<Cards.Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">

If you want to use Nextra without using these built-in themes, you can follow
the [Custom Theme](/docs/custom-theme) docs.

import { FAQ } from "@/components/faq";

<FAQ title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
	No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
	the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
	`/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other
	routes in `/app`
</FAQ>

<FAQ title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQ>

<FAQ title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
	There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
	[react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
	add live coding components to your MDX.
