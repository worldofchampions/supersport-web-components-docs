# SuperSport Web Components

SuperSport Web Components comprises a collection of UI elements designed to facilitate the
seamless integration of SuperSport's uniform interface and functionality across various platforms.

Our components are standard <ExternalLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</ExternalLink>
built using <ExternalLink href="https://stenciljs.com/">Stencil</ExternalLink>. Simply put, Web Components allow us
to create our own HTML tags using existing web standards, Stencil being a simple library helping us with the boilerplate.

These web components are then very easily integrated into any website to bring SuperSport content into your project.

## Why Web Components?

Web components offer a method for crafting custom HTML elements that can be utilised across multiple frameworks.

As the adoption of frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular continues to surge, component-driven development has
become essential. Components allow us to encapsulate styles and functionality into reusable units.

However, framework-specific components present certain limitations:

- They are bound to their respective frameworks.
- Updates or shifts to new frameworks may necessitate extensive modifications and effort to update the components.

Web components address these challenges effectively:

- They enjoy support across all modern browsers.
- They are independent of any particular framework.
- They are an integral part of the web standard.

<FAQ title="Can I use SuperSport Web Components with Next.js app router?">
	No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for
	the app router has not been implemented yet. But you can use `/app` and
	`/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other
	routes in `/app`
</FAQ>

<FAQ title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
