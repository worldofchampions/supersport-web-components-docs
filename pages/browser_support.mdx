# Browser support

This project targets modern browsers.

## What do we mean by modern browsers?

Our subjective definition is: current AND previous (stable minus two versions) of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.

For an up-to-date and detailed view of browsers supporting web components, 
please see <ExternalLink href="https://caniuse.com/?search=web%20components">Can I use - Web Components?</ExternalLink>.

In the real world, browsers evolve at different speeds. Many browsers are based on Chromium now, and they often
land Web features early. On the other side, Safari often lands Web features last. Because of this, we maintain a
more explicit list of such modern browsers and we update it every 6 months, a few months after a new Safari release gets out.

Browser Version Comments
Chrome logo Chrome >=86 Desktop & Android details
Firefox logo Firefox >=81 Desktop & Android details
Safari logo Safari >=14 macOS, iOS + WebView based browsers details
browsers based on chromium...
Brave logo Brave >=1.15 Based on Chromium 86 details
Edge logo Edge >=86 Based on Chromium 86 details
Opera logo Opera >=72 Based on Chromium 86 details
Samsung Internet logo Samsung Internet >=14 Based on Chromium 87 details
Vivaldi logo Vivaldi >=3.4 Based on Chromium 86 details
The above list is based on browser versions that were out when Safari 14 was released in september 2020.

## What does it mean for users?

As a user of this component library, you can be sure it will work in modern browsers. If you need wider browser support, you will need to adapt your project configuration and toolchain.

When it comes to CSS features, we don't have a clear solution for you right now.

When it comes to JavaScript language features, you will need to configure your toolchain (bundler, transpiler...) to transform the source of our components to something that works for your context.

When it comes to JavaScript and browser APIs than can be polyfilled, you will need to choose and load the appropriate polyfills yourself before you load our components.
