# Theming

SuperSport Web Components can be customized at a high level through design tokens. This gives you control over theme
colors and general styling. For more advanced customizations, you can make use of component variables
to target individual components.

These are built with CSS custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables) for easy
customization of an application. CSS custom properties allow a value to be stored in one place, then
referenced in multiple other places. They also make it possible to change CSS dynamically at
runtime (which previously required a CSS preprocessor), useful for a dark theme for example. CSS custom properties
make it easier than ever to override SuperSport Web Components to match a brand or theme.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the building blocks of all UI elements. In SuperSport Web Components, tokens
are [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)
that can be used to style components.

SuperSport web makes use of several design tokens to provide a consistent appearance across components. You can customize them and 
use them in your own application with pure CSS â€” no preprocessor required.

Design tokens offer a high-level way to customize the Design System with minimal effort. There are no component-specific design 
tokens, however, as design tokens are intended to be generic and highly reusable. To customize an individual component, refer to 
the section entitled Component variables.

Design tokens are accessed through CSS custom properties that are defined in the :root block of core.css. This stylesheet is imported 
when you install SuperSport Web Components, so design tokens are available on your page at that point. Because design tokens are global, 
they're always prefixed with --gr to avoid collisions with other libraries.

To customize a design token, simply override it in your stylesheet using a :root block.

```css copy
:root {
	/* Changes the primary color palette to purple */
	--ss-color-primary: #a855f7;
	--ss-color-primary-rgb: 168, 85, 247;
	--ss-color-primary-contrast: #ffffff;
	--ss-color-primary-contrast-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
	--ss-color-primary-shade: #7e22ce;
	--ss-color-primary-tint: #d8b4fe;

	/* Changes the font family */
	--ss-font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Helvetica Neue",
		"Roboto", sans-serif;
}
```

Many design tokens are described further along in this documentation. For a complete list, refer to core.css in the project's source code.

Tip: you can use these tokens in your own custom components, to align them with the SuperSport Web Components. For example:

```css copy
.sidebar {
	background-color: var(--gr-color-secondary);
	color: var(--gr-color-secondary-contrast);
	padding: var(--gr-spacing-medium);
}
```

## Component variables

The SuperSport Design System provides variables that exist at the component level, such as --background and --color. For 
a list of the custom properties a component accepts, view the "CSS custom properties" section of its API reference. For 
example, see the Button CSS custom properties.

```css copy
/* Set the color on all ss-button elements */
ss-button {
	--color: #222;
}

/* 
 * Set the background on a ss-button with a `fancy` class: 
 *`<ss-button class="default"></ss-button>`
 */
ss-button.default {
	--background: #00ff00;
}
```
